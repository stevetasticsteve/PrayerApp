This simple Qt5 app keeps a record of people to pray for in the background as a database, and randomly selects 3 names at the user's request. Once you've prayed for them their names are struck through and won't come up again until the list is finished.
It's a simple app to pray for 3 people a day.

Or to remember 3 things a day randomly from a long list.

Todo:
-Clean up error handling. Way too many except Exceptions; I was new to QT5 logging
-Make logging more useful
-Make import/export more robust and easier to use for non techies
